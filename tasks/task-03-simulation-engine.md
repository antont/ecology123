# Task 03: Simulation Engine

## 🎯 Task Description
Build the core simulation engine with stepwise execution, world grid management, and step processing logic.

## 📋 Context
- **Files to create**: SimulationEngine.ts, World.ts, StepProcessor.ts
- **Patterns**: Core simulation logic with stepwise execution
- **Dependencies**: Task 02 completed (configuration and types)

## ✅ Requirements
- Given the simulation needs, should process world state step by step
- Given the world configuration, should manage 2D grid and organisms
- Given the step processor, should handle all organism behaviors

## 🎯 Success Criteria
- [ ] SimulationEngine.ts created with core simulation logic
- [ ] World.ts created with 2D grid management
- [ ] StepProcessor.ts created with step-by-step processing
- [ ] All components are testable and well-documented
- [ ] Engine can run simulation steps without errors
- [ ] World state is properly managed and updated

## 📦 Dependencies
- Task 02: Configuration System (completed)

## ⏱️ Estimated Effort
**Medium** - Core simulation logic implementation

## 🔧 Agent Orchestration
**Not Required** - Standard TypeScript implementation

## 💻 Implementation Notes
- Create SimulationEngine class with start/stop/step methods
- Implement World class for 2D grid management
- Build StepProcessor for handling each simulation step
- Use TDD approach for all implementations
- Ensure proper separation of concerns
- Handle edge cases and error conditions

## 🧪 Testing Strategy
- Test simulation engine initialization
- Test world grid creation and management
- Test step processing logic
- Test error handling and edge cases
- Verify state consistency after each step
