# Ecological Simulation Implementation Epic

## üéØ Epic Overview
Implement a complete ecological simulation featuring a three-level food chain (Grass ‚Üí Sheep ‚Üí Wolves) with 2D grid visualization, realistic ecological parameters, and configurable simulation engine.

## üß† Thinking Process

**üéØ Restate**: Build a web-based ecological simulation with grass, sheep, and wolves in a 2D grid world, with realistic ecological parameters and stepwise simulation.

**üí° Ideate**: 
- Use NextJS + React + Redux + TypeScript for the web application
- Implement TDD approach for all code changes
- Create modular simulation engine with configurable parameters
- Build responsive 2D grid visualization
- Design realistic ecological behaviors based on literature

**ü™û Reflect Critically**: 
- Must follow TDD discipline for all implementations
- Need to balance simplicity with ecological accuracy
- Architecture should be extensible but not over-engineered
- Focus on core simulation first, then add features

**üî≠ Expand Orthogonally**:
- Consider different visualization modes
- Think about parameter tuning interface
- Plan for different ecosystem types
- Consider multi-species interactions

**‚öñÔ∏è Score & Rank**:
1. Project setup and configuration (highest priority)
2. Core simulation engine (high priority)
3. Organism models (high priority)
4. Visualization system (medium priority)
5. Testing and optimization (medium priority)

## üìã Task Breakdown

### Phase 1: Project Foundation
1. **Project Setup** - Initialize NextJS with TypeScript and dependencies
2. **Configuration System** - Create WorldConfig.ts with all parameters
3. **Type Definitions** - Define TypeScript interfaces for simulation

### Phase 2: Core Simulation Engine
4. **Simulation Engine** - Build core simulation controller with stepwise execution
5. **World Grid** - Implement 2D grid world representation
6. **Step Processor** - Create step-by-step simulation logic

### Phase 3: Organism Models
7. **Grass Model** - Implement grass growth and spreading behavior
8. **Sheep Model** - Create sheep movement, eating, and reproduction
9. **Wolf Model** - Build wolf hunting, movement, and reproduction

### Phase 4: State Management
10. **Redux Store** - Create Autodux store for simulation state
11. **Actions & Selectors** - Define Redux actions and selectors
12. **State Integration** - Connect simulation engine to Redux

### Phase 5: Visualization
13. **Grid Component** - Build React grid visualization component
14. **Organism Renderer** - Create organism rendering system
15. **Controls** - Add simulation controls (play/pause/step)

### Phase 6: Testing & Optimization
16. **Unit Tests** - Complete test coverage for all components
17. **Integration Tests** - Test simulation engine integration
18. **Parameter Tuning** - Optimize for stable ecosystem dynamics

- Keep components small and focused

## üìä Estimated Timeline
- **Phase 1**: 2-3 tasks (Project setup)
- **Phase 2**: 3-4 tasks (Core engine)
- **Phase 3**: 3-4 tasks (Organism models)
- **Phase 4**: 3-4 tasks (State management)
- **Phase 5**: 3-4 tasks (Visualization)
- **Phase 6**: 3-4 tasks (Testing & optimization)

**Total**: ~18-23 tasks estimated
