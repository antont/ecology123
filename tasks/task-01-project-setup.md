# Task 01: Project Setup

## 🎯 Task Description
Initialize NextJS project with TypeScript, install required dependencies, and set up the basic project structure for the ecological simulation.

## 📋 Context
- **Files to create**: NextJS project structure, package.json, tsconfig.json
- **Dependencies**: NextJS, React, Redux, TypeScript, testing framework
- **Patterns**: Standard NextJS project structure with TypeScript

## ✅ Requirements
- Given a new project directory, should initialize NextJS with TypeScript
- Given the project needs, should install Redux, testing, and visualization dependencies
- Given the architecture plan, should create proper folder structure

## 🎯 Success Criteria
- [ ] NextJS project initialized with TypeScript
- [ ] All required dependencies installed
- [ ] Proper folder structure created (src/, components/, etc.)
- [ ] TypeScript configuration working
- [ ] Basic NextJS app runs successfully
- [ ] Testing framework configured

## 📦 Dependencies
- None (this is the first task)

## ⏱️ Estimated Effort
**Small** - Basic project setup

## 🔧 Agent Orchestration
**Not Required** - Standard NextJS setup

## 💻 Implementation Notes
- Use `npx create-next-app@latest` with TypeScript template
- Install Redux, Redux-Saga, and testing dependencies
- Set up proper folder structure for simulation components
- Configure TypeScript for strict mode
- Ensure all dependencies are compatible

## 🧪 Testing Strategy
- Verify NextJS app runs without errors
- Test TypeScript compilation
- Verify all dependencies are properly installed
