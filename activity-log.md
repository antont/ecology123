- 🐛 - Fixed critical cell clearing bugs that were deleting wolves inappropriately during sheep grazing, wolf hunting, and organism movement
- 🚀 - Achieved ecosystem stability with wolf populations growing from 14 to 57+ instead of going extinct at step 22
- 🔄 - Implemented proper organism-specific removal instead of clearing entire cell contents
- 📊 - Enabled oscillation cycles (1-3 cycles achieved) and extended simulation duration to 118-187 steps
- 🐛 - Fixed step tracking in StepProcessor to enable proper debug logging and reproduction timing
- 🔄 - Improved wolf reproduction parameters with aggressive settings for population maintenance

# Activity Log

## 2025-01-28

- 🚀 - Implemented dynamic world scaling system - populations and movement ranges auto-scale with world size
- 📱 - Fixed visualization scaling to adapt automatically to any world dimensions  
- 🎨 - Added dynamic page title showing current world size (e.g., "Ecological Simulation (150×150)")
- 📊 - Achieved 170-step stability with 150×150 world (85% toward 200-step goal)
- 🔄 - Refactored WorldConfig to use factory function with configurable dimensions
- 🐛 - Fixed sheep evasion behavior to use full movement range for escaping wolves
- 📝 - Added comprehensive documentation for world size experimentation and visualization scaling
- 🚀 - Enhanced reproduction system with energy-dependent breeding rates based on ecological research
- 📊 - Population oscillation tests now consistently pass showing healthy ecosystem dynamics
